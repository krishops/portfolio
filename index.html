  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I recently had a desire for a career change. After much thought and discussion with people who know and love me, I came to the realization that programming would be an ideal field for me to be in. I think analytically and already have experience as an editor putting me in an ideal position to catch bugs in code.</p>
