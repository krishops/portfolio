        <img src="img/Headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Kristen Hopper">
        <p>I recently had a desire for a career change. After much thought and discussion with people who know and love
          me, I came to the realization that programming would be an ideal field for me to be in. I think analytically
          and already have experience as an editor putting me in an ideal position to catch bugs in code.</p>
