  <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
  <img src="img/Headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Kristen Hopper">
  <p>I recently had a desire for a career change. After much thought and discussion with people who know and love
    me, I came to the realization that programming would be a great field for me to be in. I think analytically
    and already have experience as an editor putting me in an ideal position to find and correct bugs in code.</p>
